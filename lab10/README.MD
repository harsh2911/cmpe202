# Summary  
  
  
AspectJ maked code simpler and easier to manage. In lab1 we have used derived classes to implement various versions of the gumball machine. In lab 10, using AspectJ we could change the structure of a class at compile time by changing the config file. This is very usefeul feature when it comes to implement varied models that can be configure driven. It makes the code more easier than lab-1 code.
